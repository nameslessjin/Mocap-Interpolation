# Mocap Interpolation
Investigate the effects of various interpolation methods (Linear and Bezier) and rotation representations (Euler angles and Quaternions) on quality of motion-captured animations. The methodology involves selecting a sequence of N frames, isolating keyframes, and then interpolating the motion for the frames in between. The resulting animation is compared to the origin to assess smoothness and any visual artifacts.
